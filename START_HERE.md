## 🚨 CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED BEFORE UPLOAD

### Action 1: Host Legal Documents (MANDATORY!)

**You MUST do this**:

1. **Create a website** (options):

   - GitHub Pages (free): https://pages.github.com/
   - Netlify (free): https://www.netlify.com/
   - Your own domain

2. **Upload these files to your website**:

   - PRIVACY_POLICY.md → https://yoursite.com/privacy-policy
   - TERMS_OF_SERVICE.md → https://yoursite.com/terms-of-service

3. **Update app.json** with real URLs:

   ```json
   "extra": {
     "privacyPolicyUrl": "https://your-actual-site.com/privacy-policy",
     "termsOfServiceUrl": "https://your-actual-site.com/terms-of-service"
   }
   ```

4. **Update SettingsScreen.js** (lines with Linking.openURL)

**Without hosted privacy policy, your app WILL BE REJECTED!**

---

### Action 2: Create Graphics Assets

**Required for Google Play**:

1. **App Icon** (512x512 PNG)

   - Professional design
   - Spaceship or cosmic theme
   - Original artwork only

2. **Feature Graphic** (1024x500 PNG)

   - "Nebula Dash" title
   - Space background
   - Eye-catching design

3. **Screenshots** (2-8 images)
   - Take from actual running app
   - Show home screen
   - Show gameplay
   - Show different game states

**Tools to use**:

- Canva (free templates)
- Figma (professional design)
- Hire on Fiverr ($10-50)

### Action 3: New Developer Account

**⚠️ CRITICAL - Your previous account was banned!**

**DO NOT create account until**:

**When creating account**:

- Use NEW Google account (never linked to old)
- Different credit/debit card
- Real business name & address

### Action 4: Build Production APK/AAB

**Commands to run**:

```bash
# Option 1: EAS Build (Recommended)
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
eas build:configure
eas build --platform android --profile production

# Option 2: Local build
npx expo prebuild --platform android
cd android
./gradlew bundleRelease
```

Output will be `.aab` file ready for Google Play.

- ✅ Never cut corners on compliance
- ✅ Respond to ALL policy notices immediately
- ✅ Maintain app quality constantly
- ✅ Listen to user feedback
- ✅ Be a model developer
